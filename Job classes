Here's a very early set of notes for job class skills/ design. Obviously some havent been added yet. This is more for anyone who might
be curious about the job classes, or wants to throw an opinion in. I'll be implementing these into the code myself, and I'll also use 
this as a changelog to record the stuff I'm adding in.
